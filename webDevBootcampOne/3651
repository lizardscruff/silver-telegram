Is this the second consolidation phase? Look carefully at BTC. Buy that saturday dip!

3651 TETHER
/3 = 1217

1217 saturday dip HODL don't sell till target
1217 on a major dip or good entry balanced point
1217 for a crash

figure out your ETH situation and try to buy in or near $500

Options:
ETHOS at 3.20
SUB around .74
EOS??? 14 - 15 sky is the limit, I guess?

Don't forget about IOTA and STELLAR you fucked up by not holding STELLAR till .47 FOLLOW THE STRATEGY FOOL!!! DON'T PANIC SELL!! WTFFFF Actually don't be so hard on yourself you still got profit. But hey, include a stop loss in your strategy so you don't lose like 80% of your profits like last time.

Strategy : 
Cash out half of Ethos at double or below a major resistance point. Keep the other half.

Cash portions of SUB out at resistance intervals. 25% of total at a time. Or hodl till all-time high.

EOS will surpass bcash I think at some point. I suspect taking profits at $30 would be wise.

think about do you wanna hodl btc or get some targets for ALTcoins(mostly recommended)
