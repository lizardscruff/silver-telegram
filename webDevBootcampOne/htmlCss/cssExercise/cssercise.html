			<p>Learn when to stop. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.</p>

		<p>Do an almighty painting with us. There comes a nice little fluffer. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light.</p>

		<p>We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. We can fix anything. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness.</p>

			<p>If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Use your imagination, let it go. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.</p>

		<p>The least little bit can do so much. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Trees grow however makes them happy. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world.</p>

		<p>This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Very easy to work these to death. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.</p>
